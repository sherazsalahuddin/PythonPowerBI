    "### Using Python in PowerBI\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, We'll be looking at how to have same python working in Power BI. \n",
    "This opens opportunity of applying Python skills on whatever data source Power BI can connect to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft. \n",
    "It provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, where end users can create reports and dashboards by themselves, without having to depend on information technology staff or database administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter which data source is being refered to, Once data is Imported in Power BI, the rest of procedure turns out to be same.\n",
    "\n",
    "One neat thing about this integration is that one can use M provided by Power BI for Data Manupilation or Manipulate data further after importing Data in Power BI using Python since data gets projected as Data Frame when a Python visulation is selected for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll be taking a CSV [Dataset](https://github.com/sherazsalahuddin/PythonPowerBI/blob/master/datacamp.csv) from an earlier [Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-python-beautifulsoup-datacamp-tutorials) of mine created earlier by collecting data from Datacamp website itself for the purpose of Analysis in Power BI along with using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset is a list of all Articles/Tutorials that have been published at Data Camp since the very beginning while gathering the following information for each one of them\n",
    "\n",
    "* Author\n",
    "* Publish Date\n",
    "* Title\n",
    "* Description\n",
    "* Up Votes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So after starting off Power BI, we start by getting data from the CSV file as show below\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](GetData.png)\n",
    "![](MenuSelection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Select DataCamp.csv as the CSV data source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below preview screen will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](DataCampPreview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Load\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Loading.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is loaded, it gets shown as a table in Power BI Data Model as show below\n",
    "\n",
    "![](DatacampModel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on Python Visual from the Visuals Gallery\n",
    "\n",
    "![](PythonVisual.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Enable to enable Script Visuals\n",
    "\n",
    "![](ScriptVisuals.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how it's going to look like \n",
    "\n",
    "![](PythonStart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Drag and Drop all the Fields to the Values Area as show below\n",
    "\n",
    "![](DragDrop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a Default Python Script that creates a Data Frame based on the Fields that were dropped in the Values area of the Visual\n",
    "\n",
    "![](DefaultScript.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on, we can proceed with writing necessary Python code as we would in a regular Editor of our choice as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt;\n",
    "import seaborn as sns;\n",
    "\n",
    "datacamp = dataset\n",
    "datacamp['publishdate'] = pandas.to_datetime(datacamp['publishdate'])\n",
    "datacamp['publishyymm'] = datacamp['publishdate'].dt.strftime(\"%Y-%b\")\n",
    "datacamp[\"posts\"] = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "datacamp[datacamp[\"publishdate\"]>='2017-01-01'].sort_values(by=\"publishdate\", ascending=True).groupby([datacamp['publishyymm']],sort=False).size().plot(kind='bar', figsize=(15,7), color='b', title= 'Since 2017')\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above script, we have done the following\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigned dataset Data Frame to a datacamp variable\n",
    "Changed Data Type of publishdate to datetime\n",
    "Added new column publishyymm that stores Month Name and Year instead of raw numbers\n",
    "Added Posts Column to count each post as 1\n",
    "Finally Visualised the Data Frame by using Plot function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This would give us the following visual \n",
    "\n",
    "![](PythonVisualResult.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above visual gives the count of Tutorials organized by Year and Month starting since 2017.\n",
    "The Filter, Aggregate, Sort and Visualize commands have been piped up into one\n",
    "\n",
    "The plt.show() command is necessary to make the visual work in Power BI as it requires the last command in the script to return a visual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have managed to achieve the following\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import a CSV File in Power BI\n",
    "* Added a Python Visual\n",
    "* Added imported fields to the visual\n",
    "* Write our own Python code to make necessary Transformations and Visualize Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this tutorial was very helpful in getting hands on using the Power of Python in Power BI!\n",
